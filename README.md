# to-do-list

A simple to-do list with beginners knowledge on jquery and python for understanding and implementation<br/>

To execute you may use following command:<br/>
In your terminal, navigate to the folder containing app.py and run the following command:   <br/><br/>
<tab>python3 app.py </tab>

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

Now once the app opens up, you can try to add new tasks and track it with timer(as of now no validations are added).
